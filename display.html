<p>Today I went to the zoo. I saw a {{ obj.one }}
{{ obj.two }} jumping up and down in its tree.
He {{ obj.three }} {{ obj.four }} through the large tunnel that led to its {{ obj.five }} {{ obj.six }}. I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray {{ obj.seven }}
towering above my head. Feeding that animal made
me hungry. I went to get a {{ obj.eight }} scoop
of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had to
{{ obj.nine }} {{ obj.ten }} to catch our bus.
When I got home I {{ obj.eleven }} my mom for a {{ obj.twelve }} day at the zoo.</p>
